# MealPlanner
A grocery tracking application for individuals or households.

This web-application is intended to allow users to add and modify food/grocery
items, recipes, and costs.

     Example: User can create recipes for meals, and by entering in amounts of
              food items, can generate costs, projections, quanities of food
              being used, that need to be used, and that need to be purchased
              to replenish stock (e.g. refrigerator)
              
This is meant to be fully supported by both desktop and mobile browsers.
