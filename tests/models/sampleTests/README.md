# How to use

Use these files to find basic tests for different variables types (strings,
integers, booleans, objects).
- Copy and paste the tests to your test file
- Replace the word `variable` with the name of the variable you are testing in
**camelCase**.
- Replace the word `Variable` with the name of the variable you are testing in
**TitleCase**.
- Replace the word `cut` with the name of the class you are testing (most
probably) in **TitleCase**.
- Adjust the sample values as necessary.
