# README
/phpunits/ This is where you should install all classes that will wrap around
the scripts in the web-application framework.

The base class is called *MealPlanner* and with that you can extend from to
create a class for each script.

# PHPUnit Tests

So as to not clutter up the code, all PHPUnits can be contained within this
directory as well. They should be named after the Object they are testing and
be placed into the sub-directory **tests/**.

Examples:

     /foods/             (Lists food)
     Foods.php           (The Object Wrapper)
     tests/FoodsTest.php (The PHPUnit test)
     
     /foods/food/        (Edits/Updates food)
     Food.php            (The Object Wrapper)
     tests/FoodTest.php  (The PHPUnit test)

# Super Global $Errors
All scripts automatically make use of an array called **$Errors** use this to
contain any errors your script may generate because of bad input.

# PHPUnitCheck()

    // PHPUnit check (should be placed after any regular errors are detected)
    PHPUnitCheck($Errors);

# src/autoload.php
Should be automatically generated by using *phpab*.
